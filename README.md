# Developing-a-program-project-for-a-bank-mortgage-calculator-to-calculate-the-monthly-payments


### In this project, I will be developing a bank mortgage calculator program that will calculate the monthly payments that the client must make in order to pay off the loan. In addition, I will be working on behalf of Kelly, who is both a bank client and an aspiring businesswoman who plans to open 3 factories in the upcoming month.

### Kelly also discovers that in order to start the factories, she needs GHS 1,000,000, but sadly she does not have that much. As a result, Kelly's business goals have taken a serious hit. Kelly, a diligent person, chooses to continue working on the project. Kelly then gets in touch with her banker, and they decide to provide her a loan so she may move forward with her project.

### Kelly calls her banker as a result, and they decide to give her a loan so she can move forward with her project. Kelly also asks her lender how much she needs to pay each month to pay off the debt. I will therefore create a software application for this purpose, in order to assist Kelly and the banker in performing accurate computations and calculations.



**I've included all of the business requirements here so that we can create software that will meet the intended business needs and be viewed favorably by managers and stakeholders who will be using the data to extract insightful information and patterns from it.**


**An example of how the software we will be building is run is shown below.**



**Here is a visual of an input**

**- mortgage loan principal**

  **principal = 100000**

**- percent annual interest**

  **interest = 7.5**

**- years to pay off mortgage**

  **years = 30**



**This is the result(outcome) of the program after it has been run(executed).**

 
**For a 30-year mortgage loan of $100,000**

 
**at an annual interest rate of 7.50%**

 
**you pay**

 
**$699.21 monthly**
 
----------------------------------------

 
**Total amount paid will be $251,717.22**


----------------------------------------

**Formula :**



**M = P [ i(1 + i)^n ] / [ (1 + i)^n â€“ 1]**

**M = Total monthly payment**
**P = The total amount of your loan**
**i = Your interest rate, as a monthly percentage**
**N = The total amount of months in your timeline for paying off your mortgage.**
